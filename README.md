# LyfeStyle Fitness Tracker
*A CPSC 304 Introduction to Relational Databases Project*

Ever wanted to track your diet? Maybe even your workouts? Well fear no longer because LyfeStyle Fitness Tracker is here!

Sure, there might be 100 other apps out there that do the same thing, but we made this one. From scratch. In about a week. I cried. Luis cried. We all cried.

Here are some features that we've currently implemented:
* Web JSON API endpoint written in PHP to pass on Oracle database access (not currently secured or authenticated in any way)
* JSON API access and parsing from our Android app to access our database
* Base login UI
* Base dashboard UI

Here are some features that we'll be implementing (hopefully):
* Login & account creation
* Dashboard graphs
* Meal tracking & diets UI
* Exercise tracking & workout plans UI
* Sleep tracking
* Consultant hiring
* Consultant dashboard with plans and users
* A beautiful UI and delightful UX

Future ideas after the end of this course if we still have the motivation to maintain this:
* Water intake tracker

Thank you for reading. Send food.
