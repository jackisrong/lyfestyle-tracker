# LyfeStyle Fitness Tracker
*A CPSC 304 Introduction to Relational Databases Project*

Ever wanted to track your diet? Maybe even your workouts? Well fear no longer because LyfeStyle Fitness Tracker is here!

Sure, there might be 100 other apps out there that do the same thing, but we made this one. From scratch. In about a week. I cried. Luis cried. We all cried.

Here are some features that we've currently implemented:
* Web JSON API endpoint written in PHP to pass on Oracle database access (not currently secured or authenticated in any way)
* JSON API access and parsing from our Android app to access our database

Here are some features that we'll be implementing (hopefully):
* Login with not-secure-but-totally-works authentication
* Account creation with not-secure-but-totally-works authentication
* Dashboard
* Meal tracking
* Workout tracking
* Sleep tracking
* Diets
* Workout Plans
* A beautiful UI and delightful UX

Thank you for reading. Send food.
